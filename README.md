# EXAM-NOTE
note and paper
Generally study notes are notes made progressively throughout a topic, term or even year. They tend to be pretty long, in-depth and cover all of the information learned. The key indication that a set of notes are study notes is that they cover everything â€“ key points and concepts, class work, extra information and general learning. They also usually go into the same amount of detail on every topic. This is why they tend to get so long.
